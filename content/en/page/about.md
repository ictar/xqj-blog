👋 Hi, I'm **Xu Qiongjie** — a researcher, developer, and content creator.

I’m currently a research fellow at the **GeoLab, Politecnico di Milano**, where I work on high-resolution land cover mapping, Earth observation, and AI-based remote sensing analysis. I enjoy exploring how satellite data and geospatial models can help us better understand urban and environmental change.


This blog is my digital garden — a space for:
- Sharing **technical tutorials** on GIS, remote sensing, and web development
- Posting notes from **academic work**, especially validation methods and dataset benchmarking

You’ll find most of my content written in **Markdown**, versioned on **GitHub**, and deployed with ❤️ on **Cloudflare Pages**.

If you’d like to collaborate, chat, or just say hi, feel free to reach out!
